# HungerGoVroom
HungerGoVroom.js, a dumb minecraft mod that could have been done much easier by just writing the code in a mod.
## A Pointlessly Silly Minecraft Mod
Introducing: An utterly pointless mod that does nothing but copy a single JavaScript file to make your hunger deplete faster into the kubejs/server_scripts folder. That's it. That's the whole mod.

Why did I do this instead of just writing the code directly into the mod itself? Because I like to challenge myself to do dumb, silly things for the laughs. Plus, a friend wanted it.

Purpose: None, except to make you laugh at the sheer absurdity of it. Enjoy!
